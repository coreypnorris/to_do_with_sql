##To do list with SQL

####This is a to do list built using Ruby with SQL on the backend.

To use it, download the zip file and navigate to the file in your terminal. Then run `ruby to_do.rb` to bring up the user interface.

We built this project while we were students at [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/). This exercise was meant to introduce us to using SQL databases in our Ruby programs.
